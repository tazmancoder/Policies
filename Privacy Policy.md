# Privacy policy

Last updated: May 22, 2024

Mark Perryman (“us”, “we”, or “our”) is an app creator with several apps on the Apple AppStore. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information we receive from users of our Apps.

## Information Collection and Use

We do not collect or store any of your personal information. Since we are not collecting your information you have no reason to fear. We cannot lose what we don't have. Nor can we give to any legal entity that which we do not have.

One of our Apps (**Farm Math**) does ask you to provide your name (*you can make up a name, provide only your first name, whatever you prefer, this name is only used to keep track of your test scores within the app to give the user some statistics on how they are progressing with their basic math facts*). This information is stored in your iCloud account only. We do not store that information.

## Security

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 24, 2024 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the Service after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.
